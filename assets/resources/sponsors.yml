# This YAML file contains the list of sponsors that gets displayed on the splash page.
#Â Progressive indentations should be two spaces each. Inconsistent indentation will invalidate the YAML.
# If you're not building the app locally, you may want to run any new YAML though a validator first.

# Example:
#
# sponsors:
#   tera:
#     items:
#       - name: Acme Development
#         website: https://www.acmedevelopment.com
#     rows: 6.0 (the number of rows the items will take up)
#     columns: 5.0 (the maximum number of columns the items should span)
